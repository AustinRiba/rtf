What is PRISM?

PRISM is the codename of a National Security Agency program which gives the NSA direct access to the servers of major American tech companies, some of which you probably use every day. Here's the list:

Microsoft
Yahoo
Google
Facebook
PalTalk
AOL
Skype
YouTube
Apple
You know all the data you've stored in your Facebook or your Gmail account? Every conversation you've had online, believing that no one would ever read it? Turns out the NSA is spying on us. All of us.

You can get all the details here (http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html).

Why should I care? I have nothing to hide.

Are you sure? Are you certain there's nothing on these companies' servers that the government could use against you? What about your family and friends?

The government is collecting, storing, and analyzing our data--what we do online, what we think, what we feel--and we have no control over what they do with it. If we give up our right to the security of our personal information, we will never, ever get it back.

But isn't the NSA just trying to stop terrorists?

Probably not, but let's assume for the sake of argument that you're right. Do you trust everyone who is employed by the NSA now, and everyone who will be employed by the NSA forever after, to always use citizens' personal information purely for the public good, and never do anything wrong with it?

The correct answer to that question is "absolutely not." (link to http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fv4r6/i_believe_the_government_should_be_allowed_to/caeb3pl)
